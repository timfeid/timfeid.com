# New Jersey Devils Android App


I built this project as a complete rewrite of my original New Jersey Devils app, transitioning from Java to Kotlin to take advantage of modern language features, better safety, and improved maintainability. The goal was to provide fans with a clean, efficient, and reliable way to stay updated on their favorite hockey team.
